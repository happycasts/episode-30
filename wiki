1. show people the .tgz and .vimball sucks
1. need to explain how to put everything into .vim/, and make a git repo
   
    mv .vimrc .vim/vimrc
    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc

1. bundler-like install, based on github, ruby, yml

1. have to talk about git submodule
1. pathogen.vim is prefered
1. delete a plugin
   delete what's in .vim/bundle, is this all?
   how is the stuff with Helptags?
1. :set rt
1. do I really need `git submodule`? Seems it is a overkill.
1. so all I want is:
   1. clean install
   1. clean uninstall
   1. easy upgrade
